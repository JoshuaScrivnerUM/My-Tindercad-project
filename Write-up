I thought that having the ability to play around with circuits online was AWESOME!
I did have a fear of breaking stuff when doing it physcially and this method removed that fear entirely.
I thought that it was pretty easy to work with, I do think having the physical manual helped.
It was also really nice not having the worry to be super percise since everything was drag and drop.
Overall I found it to be a nice way to play with arduio with little hassle!
